official website : [npmjs.com](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## What is NPM ?

NPM is an abbreviation for **"Node Package Manager"**. It is a package manager for the JavaScript programming language. NPM allows developers to discover, share, and reuse code packages and libraries in their projects.

NPM maintains a vast registry of packages, where developers can find thousands of open-source packages published by other developers. This makes it convenient for developers to leverage existing solutions and integrate them into their own projects, saving time and effort.

## Why use NPM ?

Dependency Management: NPM simplifies the process of managing dependencies in JavaScript projects. It allows developers to specify the required packages and their versions in a configuration file (package.json), making it easy to install and update the necessary dependencies.

Package Discovery: NPM provides a vast registry of packages where developers can discover and explore thousands of open-source JavaScript packages. This makes it convenient to find solutions for common functionalities and integrate them into projects without reinventing the wheel.

Code Reusability: NPM encourages code reusability by allowing developers to publish their own packages. Developers can share their code with others through the NPM registry, enabling collaboration and accelerating development by leveraging existing solutions.

Version Control: NPM allows developers to specify package versions and manage dependencies based on semantic versioning. This ensures that projects use compatible versions of packages and provides control over updates and backward compatibility.

Build Automation: NPM supports the execution of scripts defined in the package.json file. This allows developers to automate various tasks, such as building, testing, and deploying their applications, streamlining the development workflow.

Community and Ecosystem: NPM has a large and active community of developers, contributing to the vast collection of packages and providing support. This thriving ecosystem offers access to a wide range of resources, tutorials, and community-driven solutions.
